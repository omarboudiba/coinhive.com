Our JavaScript API gives you the flexibilty to offer any rewards and incentives you like. See how we successfully use it on a community site.

We also offer a captcha-like service as well as a shortlink solution that is easy to implement on your site. These services, while fully supported, should only serve as an example of what's possible.

We are excited to see how you will use our service. We dream about it as an alternative to micro payments, artificial wait time in online games, intrusive ads and dubious marketing tactics.

Your users can “pay” you with full privacy, without registering an account anywhere, without installing a browser extension and without being bombarded by shady ads. They will pay you with just their CPU power.
